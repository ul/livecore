    description = [[A high resolution vocoder.
This is the talkbox plugin ported from the MDA plugin suite. In many ways,
this Talkbox functions like a vocoder: it takes in a source signal (usually
speech), which then excites an excitation signal
(usually a harmonically rich signal like a saw wave). This particular algorithm
uses linear-predictive coding (LPC), making speech intelligibility better 
than most vocoder implementations.
